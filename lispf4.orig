******HELP
Note.
in the code there are some nonstandard statements.


In the function ratom we use double precision variables to pick upp
the value of a number beeing read. This is beceause we dont want to loose
precision when reading big integer numbers.

But then we make integer numbers
and single precision real numbers by assignment. Here you can solve
this problem by either removing the double precision declaration
or use some conversion function on your computer (double to integer,
double to real, integer do double).




   Installing Lispf4
   =================

 Lispf4 is delivered as ONE file, EXPORT, containing source code in
 Fortran, Lisp, and assembler language (only for Dec10/20 and IBM).
 Each subfile in EXPORT starts with a line containing
   ******<filename>
 where <filename> is the name of the source code file.
 The subfiles are
   HELP     this text
   DOC      installation (and user) guide
*  FLOSOR   auxiliary routines for the interpreter
*  HEART    the heart of the interpreter
*  F4COM    COMMON block with areas used by the interpreter
   MOD      modifications for full prompting (see below)
   OPENF    modifications for symbolic file names (see below)
   DEC20    assembler routines for DEC20
   DEC10    assembler routines for DEC10
   VAXFTN   machine dependent routines in Fortran for VAX11
   VAXLSP   machine dependent Lisp functions for VAX11
   IBM      assembler routines for IBM
*  FLOSYS   data file for initialization of Lispf4 bootstrap
*  LIBRRY   library functions in Lisp for Lispf4 bootstrap
   DEBUGLOG log of run with debuglines in floexp enabled

The only files that are needed to get a "primitive" system
are the 5 files marked with "*". The other files can of course
be of help if you want to fix symbolic I/O and other things.



 Below follows an overview of the installation process. You should
 also read the installation guide (subfile DOC).

 Do the following to install Lispf4:

1. Split EXPORT into the various subfiles with, e.g., an editor.
   The second subfile contains the documentation of the system with
   installation guide.

2. Find the subroutine INIT1 in the subfile FLOSOR, where some machine 
   dependent constants are defined. Change them according to the
   documentation. Note that you probably need to change declarations
   of the COMMON block in the subfile F4COM. Some areas in F4COM should
   be declared INTEGER*2 in order to save space considerably
   (e.g. CAR, CDR, and stacks). In the file delivered there are INTEGER*2
   declarations on those places where such declarations should be done.
   However, you may not get enough Lisp cells with INTEGER*2; in such
  cases you should change all INTEGER*2 declarations into INTEGER, after-which
   you may increase the CAR/CDR areas (don't forget NFREET in INIT1) from
   the current 28000 ('optimal' for INTEGER*2 CAR/CDR) into, e.g., 38000.

   All areas are declared in the COMMON block F4COM.
   The Fortran program contains statements
      INCLUDE 'F4COM.FOR'
   on those places where F4COM should be inserted.

   Caution! Don't forget to redimension IMESS, and to change FORMATs in
   RDA4 and WRA4.
   Note also that the subroutines SETCHT and GETCHT in FLOSOR make use of
   the fact that A1 format characters are stored left justified.
   On, e.g., VAX11 SETCHT and GETCHT must be redefined using the
   Fortran function MOD. (The constant CHDIV is then unused).

3. When all constants are defined you may compile and link Lispf4.
   LISPF4 uses the Fortran source code in the files FLOSOR,  HEART,
   and DUMMY.
   You may also need to program two machine dependent routines in
   assembler or Fortran (GETCH and PUTCH, see documentation).
   Be absolutely sure that GETCHT, SETCHT, GETCH, and PUTCH work
   before testing Lispf4!

4. Now you can start LISPF4. It will read some messages from logical unit
   LUNSYS (default 23). Connect LUNSYS to the subfile FLOSYS.

5. If the system starts properly you get an underline (_) as prompter.
   If the system does not start properly it's time to try to find out what was
   wrong. Most problems with lispf4 are with text and I/O. If you get problems
   you  can enable the debug lines in floexp (marked CDEBUG) and run
   lispf4. The debug lines print various parts of the buffers and pname
   on lunuts (the terminal). A log of what this output should look like is
   supplied in the file DEBUGLOG. You have to modify the A5 format in the
   debug lines to whatever A format is a  integer on your machine.
   The DEBUGLOG also shows how to load the librray file.
   Note ! on DEC20 fortran runtime will ask for a filename if you try
   to read or write on a unit that is not opened. In other systems you
   would have to open the LIBBRY.LSP file on unit 55 to get the same result
   as in the logfile. (same thing with flosys.lsp and unit 23)

6. At this point you should be able to talk to Lisp. Call the function
      (IOTAB 1 x)
   where x is logical unit number for the subfile LIBRRY.
   (this file contains all library functions and will load them all,
   if you dont want all packages you have do edit the file yourself)

7. When the file is loaded do
      (ROLLOUT 'LF3)
   The system will ask for logical unit number. Answer with logical unit
   number connected to a Fortran file for binary (unformatted) writing/reading.

8. If everything worked, try to do
     (ROLLIN 'LF3)
   and to answer with the same logical unit number as by the ROLLOUT.

9. Now LISPF4 should work!

10. Most operating systems allow references to physical file names from
    Fortran. If your OS disallows this then GOTO 12.
    Modify the function OPENF in FLOSOR, which, given a pointer to a Lisp
    string containing a file name, opens the file and returns a new
    logical unit number. The current code is made for DEC10/20.
    You must also modify the Lisp function SOPENF in the subfile LIBRRY
    which takes a Lisp file name and constructs a physical file name
    for your OS. E.G. for DEC20 it transforms the Lisp file name FOO
    into DSK:FOO.LSP before calling OPENF (Lisp function OPEN0).

11. Load OPENF before FLOSOR.

12. Compile the subfile INIT2 and put it first in the load list.
    INIT2 intercepts some initiation code in LISPF4 by directly reading
    the LISPF4 rollout from a logical unit number defined in INIT2.

13. Now we have the load order
        INIT2,(OPENF,)FLOSOR,HEART
    Load, link, and save the load module.

14. Run the load module. the system should read the LISPF4 rollout from
    unit 7 (or whatever you define in INIT2).

15. If you have defined your own OPENF then set
       (SETQ SYMBIO T)
    and roll it out on the physical file LF4 with
       (ROLLOUT 'LF4)

16. Lispf4 prints a prompt text when reading from the terminal.
    (The SUBR PROMPTTEXT may change this prompt text)
    In the delivered version the prompt text is printed on a separate
    line, but you probably prefer to print it without line feed.
    Since it is machine dependent to print Fortran strings without
    ending line feeds, you then need to redefine two I/O routines.
    The subfile MOD contains the modified code for DEC20; it is
    probably rather similar on your computer.
    MOD should be loaded before FLOSOR.

17. Most operating systems allow you to make a subroutine which is called
    when the user types a special interrupt character on the terminal
    (CTRL-H on DEC20, CTRL-C on VAX11, BREAK on IBM etc)
    In Lispf4 you may use this for interrupting the interpretation.
    You must then make an assebler routine, BRSET, which sets up an
    interrupt so that the subroutine BRSERV (without arguments) is called
    whenever the user types the interrupt character.

    The assembly code for DEC20 and IBM contains code for interrupt
    handling. Note that there are some minor changes in the main
    Fortran program for IBM. (As indicated by comments in the source
    code). The interrupt handler for IBM is written for the time sharing
    system GUTS, which should simulate correctly (hopefully) TSO.

18. On some operating systems there may be a problem that the hash
    function of Lispf4 makes use of the fact that A1 format characters
    are left justified in the word. On such systems (e.g. VAX11) you 
    should redefine the function IHADR in the subfile FLOSOR.

19. On some computers (e.g. DEC20) CAR and CDR is represented more
    efficiently by using half word pointers, but the Fortran compiler
    cannot handle small integers. In such cases one may implement CAR and
    CDR as (assembly) functions. 
    For RPLACA and RPLACD two more subroutines SETCAR(X,Y) and SETCDR(X,Y)
    need to be defined and all CAR(X)=xxx and CDR(X)=xxx must be replaced
    with calls to SETCAR and SETCDR. To simplify this all such places in
    the interpreter have the fortran line
     C*SETC*R       statement
    where 'statement' is the call to SETCAR/SETCDR replacing the previous
    Fortran line. The assembly code for DEC20 contains code for handling
    of half word integers.
      CAR,CDR,SETCAR, and SETCDR as subprograms may also be used for other
    purposes, e.g. software paging.



   In the text above we say that something should be loaded "before"
   something else. This is only a way of getting a specified module
   loaded if there are more than one module with that name. I.e in the code
   there is a dummy defined OPENF function if you have written your own
   openf you can on DEC20 

         load my-openf,main-code

   and your openf will be loaded and not the dummy one in the main code.
   If this is not possible you have to remove the OPENF dummy function in 
   the main code.
******DOC         (LISPF4 DOCUMENTATION)
INTRODUCTION
 
LISP F4 is a LISP interpreter written in FORTRAN IV.  The interpreter
is (almost) a subset of INTERLISP.  LISP F4 originates from LISP 1.5
through LISP F1 to LISP F3.  LISP F4 is about 3 - 10 times more
efficient then LISP F1 and have features like floating point numbers
and arrays.  LISP F4 is easy to implement.
 
This document contains two parts, a users guide and a implementation
guide.  The users guide presupposes basic knowledge of the LISP commands
and functions (See Haraldsson LISP-details, referred to as Ha 75).
 
       *********      USER'S GUIDE     ************
 
PRIMARY DATATYPES
 
Small integers         Range -n,n where n is implementation
                       dependent.
                       If x is the maximum positive integer
                       in a full word, n is x-size of CAR,CDR
 
 
Floating point         Range depending on the size of a full word
numbers                Characterized by BYTES, IRESOL, IPOWER, FUZZ.
 
Lists                  Given as (A B (C D)) etc.
 
Strings                Given as "THIS IS A STRING"
 
Alfanum atom.          Max. no of characters = size of I/O-buff/2
                       (default = 80).
 
Arrays                 Containing pointers,
                                  integers and
                                  floating point numbers.
 
INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS
 
A more complete description of the internal representations is
needed for a complete knowledge and usage of LISP F4 from the user's
point of view.
 
a)          THE ADDRESS SPACE.
 
The address space is shown by the following figure:
 
1                                                                 MAX
I---------------------I----------I---------------I-----------------I
NIL   alphanum atoms     lists      pointers to      pointers to
      and strings                   real numbers     small integers
 
MAX = the largest positive integer in a halfword (or full word) in
your computer.
 
b)          ALPHANUMERICAL ATOMS AND STRINGS.
 
 
               CAR             CDR
        I----------------I----------------I
        I                I             --------> property list
        I-------I--------I----------------I
                V
         global value
 
The global value of an atom is stored in CAR(atom).  (EVAL checks for
 
a bound value BEFORE a global value - as in INTERLISP but in
contradiction to LISP 1.5).  A global value may be set either by
SET/SETQ at the top level, or directly by RPLACA.  If a global value
has not been assigned, car(atom) points to the atom NOBIND.
 
STRINGS are represented exactly as atoms except for
- car(string) points to the atom STRING
- Two different strings may have the same printname.
- Strings always have themselves as the value.
 
SUBSTRINGS are like strings, but instead of having a print name
- car(substring) = SUBSTR
- cdr(substring) = (sourcestring start .length)
 
PRINTNAMES are accessed through the pointer representing the atom
and hidden from the user in a special area.
 
FUNCTION DEFINITIONS.
In INTERLISP each atom-record also has a "function field" called
function cell (Ha 75 page 4).  In LISP F4 user defined functions
are stored as LAMBDA or NLAMBDA expressions under the property
FNCELL. SUBR's and FSUBR's are recognized by their pointer-value
but in order to simulate the facility of making use of "free
function indicators", GETD is defined to return (SUBR . FOO) if
FOO is a FORTRAN coded SUBR, and (FSUBR . FOO) if it is a FSUBR.
 
The forms (SUBR . FOO) and (FSUBR . FOO) are simulated function
indicators and legal function arguments to apply.
 
Ex.:
        (DE KAR(X) ((SUBR . CAR) X>
 
This definition of KAR causes KAR to behave exactly as CAR
independently of whether CAR has been redefined to something else.
 
c)          FLOATING POINT NUMBERS AND ARRAYS
 
FLOATING POINT NUMBERS are stored in consecutive floating point words in
upper PNAME.
 
Atoms obeying the following syntax are treated as numbers.  If
floating point numbers:
 
     number::= sm ! smEsn
     s     ::= + ! - ! empty
     n     ::= d ! dn
     d     ::= 0 ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9
     m     ::= n ! n. ! n.n ! .n
 
The "E" has the same meaning as in Fortran.
 
Floating point numbers are printed as compactly as possible,
either with or without the "E".
 
ARRAYS contain pointers, integers or floating point numbers.
CAR(pointer value) = LISPF4-ARRAY
CDR(pointer value) = NIL
By this means it is possible to call a Fortran subroutine with an
actual parameter consisting of an address to an array part if the
corresponding formal parameter is a properly typed array.
 
Arrays cannot be read-in.  They are printed as
 
     #xxx         # = left square bracket
 
where xxx is the array pointer value.
 
d)          THE SYMBOL TABLE CAN BE LOOKED UPON
 
The function
        (OBLIST x)
creates a new list of atoms, with the last atom created as the first
member of the list, and the atomic argument x as the last one.  As
as T is the last one defined by a "clean" system, (OBLIST T) gives you
all but SUBR's and FSUBR's.
 
e)          VARIABLE BINDINGS IN PARAMETER STACK
 
Variable bindings are stored in a parameter stack (as in Interlisp)
and is implicitly given to EVAL, APPLY and EVLIS.
 
 Functions that use the stack.

If you want to evaluate something and skip part of the stack
you use the function EVSTK

           (EVSTK form stkpos)

This function works like eval but begins searching the stack at
stkpos.

If you are used to a function  EVALA (lisp 1.5) this is what you
should use (EVALA works but will put the alist on the stack and
that takes time)

To get a stkpos you use the function BINDENV

           (BINDENV var)

           returns stackaddress to the block before the block
           where var is bound.
           The address is returned as a smallnum 
           pointing to the topmarker of the block.
           If you try to supply anything that don't point
           to a topmarker to EVSTK or APPLYSTK you will
           get an error. This means you can only
           get lisp to start searching at a block boundary.

            The function TEST is defined to print its argument
            and print the value of it's argument outside it's
            own block.

The function applystk  will do the same as applya in the same way.
       
             (APPLYSTK func list stkpos)

Two small functions are defined. The last of them will
set R1 to (ALIST) and R2 to (ALIST T)

f)          LISTS are represented as two pointer records with
            CAR and CDR fields.
 
g)          NUMBERS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS HIGH VALUED POINTERS.
 
The value of a small integer is the value of the pointer subtracted
by a proper offset.  The value of a real number is stored in a full
word hidden from the user (but found through its pointer value).
 
ATOMS OF PREDESIGNED MEANING
 
Here is a list of those atoms which may be of interest for the LISP F4
user.
 
NIL,T           These atoms can not be destroyed by any functions
                such as RPLACA etc.
NOBIND          is stored in car of undefined atoms.
LISPF4-STRING   is stored in car of strings.
LISPF4-SUBSTR   is stored in car of substrings.
LISPF4-ARRAY    is stored in car of arrays.
ADVISEDFNS      List of advised functions.
BROKENFNS       List of broken functions.
CURFNS          List of those functions which have been defined
                before the first time (CURFILE file) was preformed.
CURFILE         Name of the current file (used by the MAKEFILE
                package).
FILELST         List of files loaded so far.  Updated by the function
                CURFILE.
*PRINTLEVEL     The printlevel used by TRACE.
 
I/O HANDLING
 
Though LISP F4 was designed to be as true a subset of INTERLISP as
possible, there do exist some minor differences.  Most of then have
to do with I/O.
 
a)          INPUT CHARACTERS OF SPECIAL MEANING.
 
.           for dotted pairs.  Must be separated by blanks!
            A '.' which can not be interpreted as 'a dotted pair'
            is read as an atom.
%           escape character
'           QUOTE character
" "         string character
<>          super brackets
 
All those characters works the same as in INTERLISP.
 
~           'rescue character'.  When this character is seen by
            the read routine, LISP F4 will enter BREAK.  (Useful
            for infinite read loops for example).
 
b)          CHANGING THE MEANING OF SPECIAL CHARACTERS.
 
The "meaning" of all characters are stored in a table which is
accessible by the function
 
            (CHTAB x)     Read the type of x
            (CHTAB x n)   Change the type of x.
                          Returns old type.
 
CHTAB uses the first character of the atom x.
The following character table is standard.
 
        Type          Means
        1             space
        2             (
        3             )
        4             <
        5             >
        6             "
        7             '
        8             user break
        9             .
        10            alphanumerical
        11            +
        12            -
        13-22         0-9
        23            %
        24            rescue character
        25            E  exponent
        26            # = square bracket
 
Ex.:  If you want to have $ as a super bracket, and > as an ordinary
letter do:
 
        (SETQ TYPE (CHTAB '%> (CHTAB 'A>
        (CHTAB '$ TYPE)
and if you want to have * as a break character do
        (CHTAB '* 8)
 
after which A*B will be read as the three atoms A * B separately.
 
c)          CHANGING LOGICAL UNITS ETC.
 
All I/O functions refer to a table with the following meaning:
 
        No            Means
        1             FORTRAN logical input no
        2             current read position
        3             left margin - input
        4             right margin - input
        5             FORTRAN logical output no
        6             current print position
        7             left margin - output
        8             right margin - output
        9             the print length
        10            the print depth
 
The table us accessible by the function
 
        (IOTAB i)     read position i in the table
        (IOTAB i val) put val in position i.  Returns
                      old value.
 
If val is T and i is 1 or 5, the default value (= standard Input/Output)
is put in position i.
 
A number of basic functions coded in LISP such as READPOS, INUNIT etc.
are defined by using IOTAB, so in practice you rarely use IOTAB
yourself.
 
d)          CHANGING STANDARD BEHAVIOR OF LISP F4.
 
The function
        (SYSFLAG i)      Read flag i.
        (SYSFLAG i x)    Change flag i to x (=T or NIL).
                         Returns old value.
is used to read/write flags with the following meaning:
 
        Flag no T (which is default) means:
        1           GBC message
        2           output is pretty printed
        3           (QUOTE s) printed as 's
        4           convert atoms to capital letters (machine dep.)
        5           Add % and " when so needed for a
                    correct read back.
        6           unused
        7           Print sublists on separate lines, unless
                    it is the first (or sometimes second) sub-
                    expression.
                    NIL means: during pretty print, do not begin
                    a new line if the current expression will
                    fit on line.
 
e)          BASIC I/O FUNCTIONS.
 
The following functions work as in INTERLISP except that they do not
have a file argument.
 
(READ)        (RATOM)        (READC)
(PRINT x)     (PRIN1 x)      (PRIN2 x)     (TERPRI)
(EJECT)       (SPACES n)
 
 
In addition the following functions are defined using IOTAB.  If
n is NIL they return the current value, otherwise a new value n is set
and the old value is returned.
 
(INUNIT n)       logical input no
(OUTUNIT n)      logical output no
(PRINTLEVEL n)   the max depth of printing.  (Lists below
                 this level will be printed as ...)
(PRINTLENGTH n)  the max length of printing.  (Elements
                 beyond this length will be indicated as ---)
 
As a matter of fact, PRINT, PRIN1 and PRIN2 are also defined in
LISP using the one and only printing function PRIN0 which is defined
as:
 
      (PRIN0 x a b)
 
      x      value to be printed (No TERPRI before or after!)
      a      =NIL Do not print % or "
             =T   Print % or " when so necessary to read
                  atoms back
             =T   pretty print with flag no 7 = NIL
             =n   (a number)      - " -       = T
 
During pretty-print, lists headed by an atom carrying the function
definition (FSUBR . QUOTE) will be treated as comments:  They will
be printed starting from 20 pos. to the left of the right margin.
Ex.:  By doing (PUTD '* (GETD 'QUOTE)) * behaves as QUOTE and
expressions like (* comment comment ...) will be printed as comments.
In addition two functions are defined:
 
      (PRINTL s1 s2 ..)
 
preforms PRIN1 on s1 s2 etc.
 
      (PRINTL-SP s1 s2 ..)
 
works as PRINTL but separates s1 s2 etc. by spaces.
 
The function

      (PROMPTTEXT string)

allows you to specify a prompt text to be printed when reading from the
terminal.

A new function REWIND is defined:
 
      (REWIND n)     Rewinds the logical unit n.
                     Rewind should be logically the same as closing the file.
 

f)          SAVE/RESTORE OF THE CORE IMAGE.
 
The functions
      (ROLLOUT lu)
      (ROLLIN lu)
 
saves/restores a compact core image of the status of LISP F4.  This
read them back at a later stage.  (an other way of saving is to use
MAKEFILE)
 
It is possible to perform ROLLIN also if the size of LISP F4 has been
changed since the last ROLLOUT.  If though the new version is too
small to hold the saved core image ROLLIN returns NIL (= failure to
rollin)
 
g)          THE MAKEFILE PACKAGE.
 
This package is coded in LISP and follows the conventions for
INTERLISP makefile.  The only commands in FILEVARS which are
implemented are:
 
       * (P ...) (PROP ...) (E ...) (IFPROP ...)
 
The MAKEFILE package is designed to work in a similar way both if your
Fortran dialect allows for symbolic file names and for only logical unit
numbers.

If you use symbolic file names, MAKEFILE and LOAD will behave as in Interlisp.

If you need to use logical unit numbers, MAKEFILE and LOAD will prompt you
for the logical unit number of the file corresponding to the symbolic name
given to MAKEFILE/LOAD. You may also provide this association with the function
 
       (OPEN file io no)
       file   your symbolic name
       io     I or INPUT for input files
              O or OUTPUT for output files
              other for input/output files
       no     FORTRAN logical unit
 
and if you have no further use of the file you may remove its logical
unit number by
 
       (CLOSE file)


For systems allowing references to physical file names MAKEFILE, LOAD,
ROLLIN, and ROLLOUT use the SUBR

      (OPEN0 file input mode)

which opens a sequential file named 'file'. If the flag 'input' is T the
file is opened for input, otherwise for output. 'mode' is T if the file
is a ROLLIN/ROLLOUT file, and NIL otherwise. OPEN0 opens the
file and returns a logical unit number which can be used by INUNIT, and
OUTUNIT, ROLLIN, or ROLLOUT.

The function

       (CURFILE file)
 
declares that new function definitions shall 
belong to this file and will be added to the list fileFNS.
The global variable CURFILE contains the name of the current file.
 
 Ex.:  Define some functions and save them as your file MYFILE on the
logical unit 25.
 
        (OPEN 'MYFILE 'O 25)       (this line not needed when your system
                                    uses symbolic file names, or if you let
                                    MAKEFILE prompt you for logical unit
                                    number of MYFILE)
        (CURFILE MYFILE)
        (DE ....>
        (DE ....>
        etc.
        (MAKEFILE 'MYFILE T)
 
A pretty printed version of all functions is now written on unit 25
(argument no 2 is used as PRIN0's argument no 3 when it performs the
printout).
 
ERROR HANDLING AND BREAK.
 
Mostly all errors detected by LISP F4 call the function SYSERROR
which is a SUBR and which calls RESET after printing a message.
SYSERROR is then redefined in one of the standard LISP packages as
a LAMBDA function which calls BREAK1 after the message.

BREAK1 is the ordinary "break-function" and may therefore also have been
called by a user setup break, and inside BREAK1 the following
commands exist:
 
        !        return to previous break if any. Otherwise reset.
        GO       print "broken form" and continue.
        OK       continue
        RETURN x return the value of x.
        EVAL     eval broken form and break afterwards.
                 The value of the form is stored in the atom !VALUE
        !EVAL    as EVAL etc, but the function
        !GO         is first unbroken
        !OK         then rebroken
        UB       unbreaks the function.
        BR       breaks the function.
        BT       backtrace of function calls 
        BTV      backtrace of function calls and variable bindings
        (BTV*)   (a function call!). Total backtrace of everything on
                 the parameter stack.
        ?=       prints the arguments of the broken function
 
        any other input is evaluated and value is printed.
 
In addition to BREAK1, the functions BREAK0 BREAK UNBREAK REBREAK and
TRACE are defined and work as in INTERLISP.
 
There also exists a function BREAK11, which is a LAMBDA version of
BREAK1 (which in turn is a NLAMBDA) and a function UNTRACE.
 
Each error is associated with a number.  The function
 
        (ERRORN)
 
returns the number for the last error occurred, and
 
        (ERRORMESS n)
 
prints out a corresponding message.
 
Note that you may modify SYSERROR in order to introduce your own handling
of certain types of errors. For example, it is trivial to introduce run 
time expanded macros by using SYSERROR. You then only have to modify SYSERROR
so that the macro is expanded and evaluated if you get 'undefined function'
((ERRORN)=2) and if the undefined function has a macro definition.

On most computers it is possible to associate an interrupt with some
special character so that an interrupt occurs whenever the user types that 
character. In the implementation guide it is described how to implement
keyboard interrupts within Lispf4. If your implementation has keyboard
interrupt you will enter a BREAK whenever you type the interrupt character.
The interrupt feature is very useful for breaking indefinite looping.
It may also be used for interrupting printings of large S-expressions.

The interrupt characters  are normally
    DEC20:        CTRL-H
    VAX11:        CTRL-C
    IBM/370:      BREAK
Check with your Lispf4 implementor for the interrupt character on your
Lispf4 implementation!

EDIT
 
Two edit functions are implemented:
 
        (EDITF fn . edcom)    edit a function.  Value = NIL.
        (EDITS s edcom)       edit any s-expr.  Value = s
                              edcom = list of edit commands
                              (or NIL).
 
The following commands are implemented.
 
        P                Print to level 2
        PP               PrettyPrint to level 2
        ?                Print to level 100
        ??               PrettyPrint to level 100
 
Note: In INTERLISP the print commands are not exactly as ours.
 
        OK               Leaves the editor
        UP               Sets the c(urrent)expr, so that car of
                         new cexpr is equal to the old cexpr.
        F expr           searches the first occurrence of expr
                         in the cexpr regardless of level
        NX               next expression
        !                sets cexpr to top level expression
        S x              set x to cepr.  Useful in combination
                         with US.
        n                An integer, if positive set cexpr to the
                         n:th element of cexpr, if negative to the
                         n:th element from the end, and if n=0
                         cexpr := superexpression which contains cexpr.
        (n)              n >= 1 deletes the n:th expression of cexpr
        (n e1 ...)       n >= 1 replaces the n:th expression by e1 ...
        (-n e1 ...)      n >= 1 inserts e1 ... before the n:th element.
        (N e1 ...)       adds e1 ... to the end of cexpr
        (R x y)          All occurrences off x are replaced by y.
        (BI n m)         Both In.  Aleft parenthesis is inserted before
                         the n:th element and a right parenthesis is
                         inserted after the m:th element.
        (BO n)           Both Out.  Removes both parenthesis from the
                         n:th element.
        (LI n)           Left In.  Inserts a left parenthesis before the
                         n:th element and a corresponding right at the
                         end
        (LO n)           Left Out.  Removes the left parenthesis from
                         the n:th element.  All elements after the
                         n:th element are deleted.
        (RI n m)         Right In.  Inserts a right parenthesis after
                         rest of the n:th element is brought up to the
                         level of the current expression.
        (RO n)           Right Out.  Removes the right parenthesis from
                         the n:th element, moving it to the end of the
                         current expression.  All elements following
                         the n:th element are moved inside the n:th
                         element.
        (: e1 ...)       Replaces current expression by e1 ...
        (MBD e1 ...)     Ex.:  We have (PRINT X) and we want
                               (COND ((NULL L) (PRINT X) NIL)
                                     (T (PRINT X) (GO LOP)))
                               we do
                               (MBD (COND ((NULL L) * NIL)
                                          (T * (GO LOP))))
        (XTR e1 ...)     Ex.:  We have (COND ((NULL L) NIL)
                                             (T (PRINT L))
                               and we want (PRINT L)
                               we do
                               (XTR 3 2), (XTR (PRINT L)) or
                               (XTR PRINT)
        (MARK x)         Save the current chain in x.
S and US can be used in different edit sessions.
 
Ex.:  Move the PROG expression of FOO to be the PROG expression of
another function FII.
 
        (EDITF FOO)
        F PROG S DEF OK
        (EDITF FII)
        (US DEF (3 DEF)) OK
 
The 3:rd element (the prog expression of FII) is replaced by the one
stored in DEF.
 
MISCELLANEOUS
 
A new function GO* is defined as a FSUBR.
 
        (GO* LAB)
 
searches through all current PROG's for a label LAB.  If it is found
a jump is performed.  If it is not, NIL is returned and no other action
takes place.
 
GO* is a way of implementing ERRORSET, ERRORBANG, TRYTOEVALUATE, FAIL,
etc.
 
Ex.:
ERRORSET is defined as:
 (DE ERRORSET (ERRORFORM ERRFLG)
             (PROG NIL
                   (RETURN (LIST (EVAL ERRORFORM)))
               ERRORSET>
 
and SYSERROR is defined as:
 
(DE SYSERROR (ERRORTYPE FN ARG FORM)
             - print message if ERRORFLG = T -
             (GO* ERRORSET)
             (BREAK11 FORM T NIL>
 
When SYSERROR is called it tries to jump to the laber ERRORSET.  If it
succeeds (error occurred under errorset) a "big jump" to ERRORSET is
performed and the function ERRORSET returns NIL.  Otherwise BREAK11 is
called.
 
String functions:
 
In addition to those explained in Ha 75 (page 108) three new string
functions are defined:
 
             (STRALLOC n c)
 
The first character of the literal atom (or /sub/string) c is fetched,
and a new string of length n is allocated, and filled with the character
from c.
 
Other functions not reported in Ha 75 are:
 
             (ABS n)
             (ADDLIST a l)    if memb(a,l) then l else cons(a,l)
             (SORT l)         Destructive sorting function
             (EVLIS l)        mapcar(l,'EVAL)
             (GCGAG flg)      Print message when GBC (if flg = T)
             (NTH l n)        Performs CDR n-1 times on l
             (RPT n s)        evaluate s n times
             (RPTQ n s)       as RPT but s is not evaluated at calling
                              time.
             (SIGN n)         0 or 1 or -1 depending on the sign of n
             (CLOCK)          time in milliseconds.
             (TIME)           time of the day
             (DATE)           current date
                              Note that the implementation of CLOCK, TIME,
                              and DATE are machine dependent. They are
                              implemented by the subroutines MSLFT, TIME,
                              and MDATE.
                              
             (RECLAIM n)      n=0 Normal GBC
                                1 Compacting GBC
                                2 Big number GBC
                                3 Big number/Atom GBC
             (XCALL fn l)     A way of calling FORTRAN routines.
                              Returns NIL in the virgin system.

 
Array and floating point functions
 
             (ARRAY s si sf) = a
 
Creates an array with space for s elements.  Out of these s elements,
si are to be integers and sf are to be floating.  The elements are
initially set to NIL, 0 ,and 0.0, respectively.
 
             (ARRAYSIZE a) = (s si sf)
 
gives the sizes of the array a.  S, si and sf have the same meaning
as above.
 
             (ELT a j) = x
             (ELTI a j) = i
             (ELTR a j) = f
 
picks the element j of the pointer, interger or floating part of a.
Within each part, the elements are indexed from 1 and upwards.
 
             (SET a j x) = x
             (SETI a j i) = i
             (SETR a j f) = f
 
 
             (IQUOREM j k) = (quotient . remainder)
 
This function performs an integer division of j by k.
 
             (ARRAYP a) = a or NIL
 
ARRAYP returns a if a is an array, otherwise NIL.
 
             (FIXP i) = i or NIL
 
FIXP returns i if i is a small integer, otherwise NIL.
 
             (FLOATP f) =f or NIL
 
FLOATP returns f if f is a floating point number, otherwise NIL.
 
There is no special floating point arithmetics.  Instead, as long as
all operands in a computation are integers, integer arithmetics is used.
If any operand is floating, floating point arithmetics is performed.
 
          **** IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE ****
 
HOW TO IMPLEMENT LISP F4 ON YOUR COMPUTER.
 
The LISP F4 system consists mainly of three parts:
A.  The interpreter (master version) written in FORTRAN IV
B.  'SYS-ATOMS' A file which will be read by LISP F4 at initiation.
    (this file is named FLOSYS.LSP)
C.  Additional functions, written in LISP.
 
For easy and secure implementation do as follows:
 
1. (this section is removed)
 
2.
If you want to generate your own version or change in one of the pre-
designed versions, here are the variables at hand.
 
NAME       REMARK                               CORR. ARRAY IN COMMON
 
JBYTES     Bytes in a Lisp pointer
IBYTES     Bytes in an integer
BYTES      Bytes in a real number
           (BYTES and IBYTES must be multiple of JBYTES)
NATOM=n    No of atoms                          PNP(n+1)
NFREET=f   f > 2*n.  No of atoms + cons cells   CAR(f), CDR(f)
NSTACK=s   s > 500                              STACK(s)
NHTAB=h    h == 1.5*n                           HTAB(h)
                  == means "about"
NPNAME=p   p == 2*n                             PNAME(p+2)
HILL=hill  size of parameter stack              jack(hill),jill(hill)
           hill == s

IRESOL     The precision of a floating point number (in decimal digits).
IPOWER     max(abs(p)), if floating point numbers are represented as
           m*10**p, abs(m)<10
FUZZ       will compensate for truncation errors in certain cases.
           Should be set to 5*10**(-IRESOL)
NBYTES=nb  nb = 2**x, where x = no of bits in a
           byte (normally x = 6 for BCD, 7 for
           ASCII and 8 for EBCDIC).
           (Can be 8 for ascii too)
MAXBIG     The largest positive integer that fits
           in a full word.
MAXINT     The largest positive integer that fits
           in the word size used for CAR and CDR.
           (If you don't use half word integers,
              MAXINT = MAXBIG).
CHDIV=d    Used for calculating an index from a
           character.  If CH is an INTEGER,
           holding a character left justified the
           value of i=ABS(CH/d)+1 must be in the
           range (1,nb).  CHDIV is only used in
           routines GETCHT and SETCHT.  Make sure
           that they work!  If they do not, LISP F4
           will fail while reading the SYS-atoms
           and consequently never reach the LISP
           top-loop.
im         = MAXMESS*NBMESS/IBYTES              IMESS(im)
           Don't forget to redimension IMESS!

  The remaining system variables need only be changed in certain cases.

MAXMESS    Number of messages
NBMESS     Max number of characters in a message
           Change it only when you add more
           (and longer) messages to the system.
LUNIN=li   Logical input.
LUNUT=lu   Logical output.
LUNSYS=ls  Logical unit for the SYS-atoms.
MAXLUN     The largest logical unit number
           allowed
IOBUFF     Size of ABUFF, BUFF,RDBUFF and PRBUFF
           Normally = 150.
NCHTYP=c   No of different "character types"
           such as ( ) < > etc.
NAREA      Length of common /B/ from ARG to
           DREG(7).
 
 
3.
Depending on how many bytes an INTEGER can hold you may have to change
the FORMAT(...,A4) in RDA4 and WRA4 to FORMAT(...,A5) (or whatever)
 
4.
If your compiler requires it, insert a PROGRAM statement at the
beginning of the FORTRAN code.
 
5.
Observe, that the COMMON block is separated from the rest of the
FORTRAN code and replaced by:
 
     INCLUDE 'F4COM.FOR'
 
instead.  This makes it easy to change the common block.
 
6.  Non-standard FORTRAN routines
The routines GETCH and PUTCH are normally coded in assembler.
They used for moving bytes (characters) to/from an array.
They can also be coded in Fortran if your Fortran dialect allows for
byte manipulation. The subfile VAXFNT contains this Fortran code for VAX11
Fortran.

  Calling format:

      CALL PUTCH(VEC,CH,I) Move to place I in VEC from the character CH.
      CALL GETCH(VEC,CH,I) Move from place I in VEC to the character CH.
 
The character in CH is left justified (with space padding).  Characters
in VEC are numbered 1,2,.... (1 = the leftmost one). 
Note that some computers (e.g. VAX11) store characters right justified.  

The following three operating system dependent subprograms are
initially dummy defined. If you want them to work correctly you have
to define them according to your operating system.

The subroutine MSLFT(I) returns the number of milliseconds left in
the job. This value can be used to test how much time is left in the job
when you are running in batch. Nowdays lisp is usually run interactively
and the function is somewhat obsolete. On the DEC20 implementation
mslft returns number of milliseconds cpu time the job has consumed and
is used mainly for timing purposes.

The subroutine MDATE(ISTR) sets ISTR to the current date as a 
10 character string. If your computer returns date in an other format
that is not 10 characters (maybe 8 or 12) you will also have to change
in the HEART routine, the change is easy you have to tell the lengt in
2 places that are marked in the code. Search in the code for mdate and
change the two 10's to whatever lengt you use.

The subroutine MTIME(ISTR) sets ISTR to the current time of day.
If your time format is not 5 characters you change in the code as above.


The subroutine BRSET without arguments is used for setting up terminal
interrupts. BRSET should set up the interrupt so that the subroutine
BRSERV without arguments is called whenever the user types a predefined
break character (e.g. CTRL-H on DEC20, CTRL-C on VAX11, BREAK on IBM).

It is very machine dependent how you can trap interrupts. If the specification
above is difficult to implement you can do it in some other way.
The way it works is that whenever the user types a break character the logical
variable IBREAK in the common /A/ should be set to .TRUE.

7.
It is now time to compile and run the system.  Assign your
input (LISP-CODE) to logical unit li (normally teletype), and your
output to lu (normally teletype).  The file SYS-atoms should be
assigned to logical unit ls.  If all is OK so far, the system starts
(after reading the SYS-atoms) with a message
   LISP F4, LATEST UPDATE =
   .....
 
That is, when lispf4 starts it will read the system atoms from
the unit ls (unit 23 in the distributed code). When the system atoms
are read Lispf4 will write a message on unit lu (unit 5 in the code)
and start reading expressions from unit li (5 in the code). If everything 
works you should now be able to typ in forms and get them evaluated.
i.e you type (PLUS 6 7) after the prompter and lispf4 answers 13.


8.
Read those LISP-package you want to use.
To change standard input in the "scratch" system, use
   (IOTAB 1 unit)
You may choose between:
   BASIC1          (this one is necessary)
   BASIC2
   IO1
   FUNC1           DE, DF etc
   DEBUG1          BREAK,ADVISE, TRACE
   DEBUG1          BREAK1, error
   MAKEF           MAKEFILE
   EDIT            STRUCTURE EDITOR
 
You must ofcourse have assigned the files above to a unit in some
way before you try to read them.


9.
For convenience you may now save your system by doing
    (ROLLOUT unit)
 
This file must also some way have been assigned to unit.

10.
Next time you enter LISPF4 start with (ROLLIN unit).
 
11.
Or, if you want to, replace the subroutine INIT2 by CALL ROLLIN(unit)
and you have not to care about the SYS-atoms any longer.
 

Once more

compile all the code
somehow assign

    the file FLOSYS      to unit LUNSYS (variable you set in intit2)
    the terminal (input) to unit LUNINS            "--"
    the terminal (output)to unit LUNUTS            "--"
 
  optionally (but needed if you want to read lispcode or do a rollout)

     the file BASIC1     to unit X
              BASIC2     to unti Y
                .................

     some file (why not LISPROLL) to untin Z


     now you can read BASIC1 by doing (IOTAB 1 X) etc.
     or save the system by (rollout Z).

If your system allows dynamic opening of files you can change the
code in init2 so that lispf4 opens the file FLOSYS at runtime, in
this way you will not have to assingn the lunsys unit to the file. A
commented portion in the code shows how this can be done in DEC20
fortran.

In the same way you could of course open the terminal for input on LUNINS
and output on LUNUTS  if it is needed. This is not the case on DEC20.

You can also write the function OPENF so that it works on your machine
and then you don't have to assign any files before you run LISPF4. The
OPENF function is ducumented later in this paper. The distributed code
contains a dummy definition of this function. Code that shows how this 
function is implementet for DEC20 is also supplied.

Additional hints:
 
- The range for small integers (MAXINT-BIGNUM)/2 should not be too
small.  Make it > 1000.
 
- The routine GARB may call LISPF4 "recursively" in case of error.
This is done only in order to offer the user a nice error handling,
but if your OS checks (and prohibits) "recursive" calls in FORTRAN you
must either do it indirectly through an assembler routine or replace
the call by an "error-return" by locking the stacks and placing an
error code at the top of FSTACK.    
 
INTERNAL REPRESENTATIONS.
 
On the next page there is a picture over the most important areas and
pointers used by the system.  Pointers are marked with straight arrows
(--------> ) and the flow of character are marked with sparse arrows
( - - - - -> ).
 
Alpha numerical atoms:
 
Let us follow what will happen when the atom FOO is read and printed.
FOO is stored in RDBUFF by a previous FORTRAN-READ (with A1 format).
RDPOS points to "the next character to be read".
FOO is now inserted to ABUFF and escape characters are moved.  Before
being moved the character is used an an index in CHTAB to determine its
type.  A hash address is calculated and used as entry in HTAB.  Suppose
that FOO has not been read before.  After finding an empty place in HTAB
this place is updated to point to NATOMP and NATOMP is increased by one
(new atoms are stored consecutively).  Suppose that NATOMP had the old
value i.  The printname FOO is now stored in PNAME, JBP are
updated to point to the next empty character position in PNAME.
(Also printnames are stored consecutively starting from the bottom).
The starting address for the printname  is stored in PNP(i) and the
ending address+1 is stored in PNP(i+1).  A pointer to the atom NOBIND
is placed in CAR(i) and CDR(i) is set to NIL.  Finally the pointer
i is returned to the caller.
If later on FOO is to be printed, the print routine recognizes FOO as
an atom (the pointer value i is below NATOM).  The printname is
fetched using PNP(i) and PNP(i+1) and moved to the PRBUFF at position
PRTPOS.  While moving CHTAB is consulted to check if escape characters
(%) are needed.  When PRBUFF is filled up (PRTPOS > MARG) or if
terpri() is called, the line is printed using FORTRAN-WRITE with
format (1X,150A1).

Small integers:
 
The address space NFREET + NATOM - MAXINT is reserved for small integers,
and they are stored in the list structures as pointers.  The numerical
value of a small integer is pointer-NUMADD.
 
Floating point numbers:
 
Real numbers are represented as pointers in the address space NFREET + 1
- BIGNUM.  The length of this range is NATOM.  The integers themselves
are stored consecutively as full word integers in PNAME starting form
the top and using NUMBP as "free real space pointer".  When no more
 
Strings:
 
do not have an entry in HTAB and that a pointer to the atom STRING is
stored in CAR(i).  ("" are removed from the printname by the read
routine and added if asked for by the print routine).
 
Substrings:
 
representing atoms and strings (1,NATOM).
CAR(substring) = SUBSTR
CDR(substring) = (sourcestring start . length)
Substrings do not have a  printname of it's own (and thus do not occupy
space in HTAB or PNAME).
 
Lists:
 
The variable NFREEP points to the free list.  After a compacting
garbage collection the free list is a consecutive list of cons cells
starting from NFREEP and growing backwards down to NFREEB.
 
ARRAYS are stored in a way similar to that of atoms and stings.
All array data are stored in the Fortran array PNAME.  Arrays are
referred to by pointers in the range (T+1,NATOM).  Every array
consists of three parts, each one of which may have zero length.
The details are as follows:
 
             (z is zero or more slack bytes.)
             (i,j,k,l are byte pointers into PNAME.)
 
x        = the array pointer value
CAR(x)   = LISPF4-ARRAY
CDR(x)   = NIL
PNP(x)   = i
PNP(x+1) = l
 
PNAME:
 ....(z j k (pointers) z (integers) z (f. p. n.)) ....
      !                !            !             !
      i                j            k             l
 
The three array parts all start on a word boundary.  By a word we
mean the basic storage cell for a data type.  (E.g. half machine
word, full machine word, double machine word, etc.).
 
By this means it is possible to call a Fortran subroutine with an
actual parameter consisting of an address to an array part if the
corresponding formal parameter is a properly typed array.  The
advantage of this method, instead of having pointer arrays, is that
we do not have to "unbox" and "box" numbers before and after calls
to e.g. numerical routines.  For further details see the description
of subroutine ARRUTL.
 
RECURSIVE PROGRAMMING IN FORTRAN.
 
The definition of the LISP F4 interpreter is highly recursive
and in this chapter we will explain how recursion has been programmed.
 
The stack:
 
There are two stacks for recursive calls of sub functions.  One stack
(named ASTACK) is used for saving values which are to be saved during
a recursive call.  The other stack (named FSTACK) is used to hold
return jump indicators, here represented as integers which are used in
a computed GOTO-statement.  Both ASTACK and FSTACK are physically
stored in the same vector STACK using IP and JP as stack-top pointers.
 
                 STACK
  NSTACK ----> ---------
               I  val  I
               I  val  I          part ASTACK
               I  val  I
       JP ---> I  val  I
               I       I
               I       I
               I       I
       IP ---> I  ret  I
               I  ret  I
               I  ret  I          part FSTACK
               I  ret  I
        1      ---------
 
Pushing and popping are done by the routines
 
        APUSH APUSH2 APUSH3
        APOP  APOP2  APOP3
        FPUSH
 
and sometimes (for efficiency) in line as in
        998 I = STACK(IP)
            IP = IP - 1
 
Recursive calls and returns:
 
All recursive functions are coded in the FORTRAN subroutine LISPF4.
That means that they are not subroutines themselves but just pieces of
FORTRAN code.
A call is performed by saving necessary values with APUSH (or APUSH2,
APUSH3) and by saving a return jump indicator with FPUSH.
After all this pushing follows an unconditional GOTO to the "function"
and the follows (normally) a statement with the same statement number
as indicated by IND, there the execution is to continue at return from
the calling function.  Saved values are the fetched by a proper number
of calls to APOP.
A return form a recursive function is done by GOTO 998 where the
indicator saved on FSTACK is popped and used in a computed GOTO-
statement leaving the program control to the caller.
 
N.b.
In order to give the user a change in case of stack overflow, we have
done the following:
Whenever the difference JP-IP becomes less than a preset value MIDDL,
MIDDL is divided by 2 and SYSERROR is called (which in turn normally
calls the break package).  When MIDDL has become too small RESET is
performed and MIDDL is reinitialized to its original value.
 
THE EVAL-APPLY SYSTEM.
 
Eval-apply and all SUBR's and FSUBR's are handled by (or called from)
the subroutine LISPF4 which is "the heart of the interpreter".
Calling format is
 
       CALL LISPF4(IND)
 
where IND = 1 means "this is the first call to LISPF4".
          = 2 means "restart the interpreter"

 
The top level loop is defined as
 
      lispx();
      error();
      reset();
 
where lispx() is a SUBR defined as
 
      loop:  print(eval(read())); go loop;
 
but may be redefined by the user.
 
Transmission of arguments:
 
The variables ARG, ARG2 and ARG3 are reserved to hold the first three
arguments to SUBR's.
In case of SUBRN (see below) and FSUBR arguments are pushed onto ASTACK
and the number of arguments are held in the variable IARGS.  The value
of a function is assigned to IRES before returning and IRES is
EQUIVALENCE:s to ARG.  (Sometimes an argument just passes through).
In addition the variable FORM holds the form currently under
execution.
 

               Variable bindings in  lispf4
 

LAMBDA, NLAMBDA and PROG variables are pushed onto the parameter
stack (the arrays JACK and JILL) in traditional manner.  This list
should be thought of as a simulated variable stack (and is used
implicitly by eval, apply, setq, etc.).
 

Lisf4 use a stack for bindings very much like interlisp.  Each slot
on the stack holds variable name and value. In the fortran code the
stack is made up of to arrayes JACK and JILL. At a given moment the
global variable ENV points to the position of the stack that is the
environment. A global variable TOPS points to the last used slot on
the stack.

When eval evaluates a variable it will first scan the stack starting
at ENV if no value is found it will then look in the value-cell
(i.e. CAR) of the atom and if there is no value there then there is
an error.  When we enter a function we must bind its lambdavariables
on the stack and when we leave the function we must restore the
stack as it was before.

To do this we bind variables in blocks on the stack. One block for
each function. These blocks must contain information to make it
possible to remove them when we leave a function. This information
is kept in the tops marker slots. For debugging (and also used
internaly) purpose we keep the form (i.e. usually function call) in
the bottom marker.  A picture of the stack after 2 function call is
showed below.  In the first block the variable (atom) FUM is bound
to -23 and the variable FOOBAR is bound to nil.

            JACK         JILL

                 top marker
ENV -->    -------------------------
           ! BAR       !   77      !
           ! FOO       !   88      !
           -------------------------
                 bottom marker
                 tops marker
           -------------------------
           ! FUM       !   -23     !
           ! FOOBAR    !   NIL     !
           -------------------------
                 bottom marker



     The bottom and top marker.

The top marker must hold information that makes it possible for us
to restore the stack after function call. JILL of the tops marker
points to the previous tops marker. This makes it possible to drop
the block by doing TOPS =: JILL(TOPS). We also must restore the
environment and JACK of the topmarker points to previous
environment. Thus we restore environment by doing ENV =: JACK(ENV).

But couldn't TOPS and ENV be the same? . No some functions don't
bind variables on the stack (SUBR and FSUBR). We also want to be
able to evaluate some forms in a environment that we manipulate
ourself.  A funarg expression would put it's bindings on the stack
but would let it's topmarker JACK (the environment pointer ) point
to 0 .

When we look for bindings on the stack we start in the block pointed
to by ENV. When we have searched that block we follow this block's
environment pointer (that's JACK) to the next block. When we find an
environment pointer that points to 0 we are ready.

When we leave a function we always drop the block on tops of the
stack.  If the function was one that binds variables on the stack we
also restore the environment.

The bottom marker holds in JACK a pointer to *FORM
and in JILL a pointer to the FORM


Lets look what the interpreter does when we evaluate a userdefined
function.
           The form is (FOO FIE FUM (SETQ BAR 77))
           FOO is defined  (DE FOO (X Y)(CONS X Y))


          LAMBDA and NLAMBDA case
          =====================
           1. Put bottom marker 
                 PREV := TOPS-1    ! we must rememer the previous block
                 JACK(TOPS) := *FORM
                 JILL(TOPS) := FOO FIE FUM (SETQ BAR 77)
                 TOPS := TOPS+1
           2. Find the lambdalist (X Y)
           3. Find arglist        (FIE FUM (SETQ BAR 77))
           4. Take first element in the lambda list
              put it in JACK(TOPS)
              take first element of arglist
              put it in JILL(TOPS)
              arglist := rest(arglist)
              lambdalist := rest(lambdalist)
              TOPS := TOPS+1
              repeat step 4 until arglist is empty.
              If the lambdalist becomes empty before
              the arglist someone has called a function
              with more arguments than the function can use.
              This is not what I call good programming but it's
              allowed in interlisp and therefore allowed in LISPF4.
              The extra arguments all get the name -*-.
              The extra arguments are evaluated so if the evaluation
              has side effects you could use this (miss)feature.

           5. Put the top marker 
                JILL(TOPS) := PREV

               Now we must evaluate all the arguments.
               At this time the bindings in this block
               are not in the environment so we can
               use JACK(TOPS) to something else.
               We temporary let JACK(TOPS) := JILL(TOPS)
               And we let JILL(TOPS) point to the argument
               under evaluation.

                The tops block now looks like this

                                                            !- TOPS (global
              !--  LINK,,LINK -------------------------!  <--     variable)
    link      !    -*- (SETQ BAR 77)                   ! link to
    to        !     Y  FUM                             ! argument
    prev.     !     X  FIE                             ! under
    block     !   *FORM (FOO FIE FUM (SETQ BAR 77))  <-! evaluation
              !
              !->  LINK,,LINK


 Now you call eval with each argument. When the argument is
evaluated
 its put in JILL(JILL(TOPS)) and JILL(TOPS) is increased with 1.
 When all arguments are evaluated we let JILL(TOPS) := JACK(TOPS)
 JACK(TOPS) := ENV, ENV := TOPS.

Then we call eval with the body of the function.



Representation of SUBR's and FSUBR's etc.
 
The type of a function (if not LAMBDA or NLAMBDA) is indicated by the
pointer value of the atom itself as seen in the following picture:
 
 NIL
I----------I----------I----------I----------I----------I----------I--...
 1       SUBR0      SUBR1      SUBR2      SUBR3      SUBRN      FSUBR
 
I                          SUBR's                      I FSUBR's    I
 
SUBR's with no arguments are numbered in the range 1-SUBR0 and so on
for SUBR1, SUBR2 and SUBR3.  In the range SUBR3+1 - SUBR we have
SUBR's with an indefinite number of arguments (as PLUS).  FSUBR's are
numbered in SUBR+1 - FSUBR.
These conventions make it easy for apply to determine the proper
argument actions and then jump to the corresponding code using the
pointer value of the atom in a computed GOTO.
(SUBR . f) or (FSUBR . f) in the case of FORTRAN coded lisp functions.
In practice getd(f) is used inline in eval-apply and does not
construct the list (SUBR . f), but as (SUBR . f) is a legal function
form, cases like ((SUBR . f) ...) are also taken care of.
 
Error handling:
 
Two classes of errors may occur in the system.
 
1.  Hard errors - reset() is called.
detected inside LISPF4) or perform CALL LISPF4(2) if detected by an
other subroutine (garb is the only subroutine that does this).

 
2.  Soft errors - syserror() is called.
All these errors jump to a place where a call to
 
          syserror(errno, fn, args, form)
 
is built up and sent to apply for further action.
RESET.  Normally SYSERROR is redefined in lisp to make use of the
break package after the message.
 
 
Though eval-apply works as given in appendix B not all help functions
are called but placed inline.  Moreover it does not recursively call
EVAL when the form to be evaluated is the last one in
- PROGN
- a LAMBDA body
- a COND or SELECT clause.
 
Especially as (LAMBDA (..) S) is quite a common expression this little
trick saves a lot of good stack storage when recursion digs down.
 
 
HOW TO ADD NEW SUBRs AND FSUBRs

There are two ways of adding Lisp functions to the interpreter. The
simplest way is to use XCALL(NO,ARGS); the other way is to add inline code
to the heart of the interpreter, i.e. LISPF4.

1. How to use XCALL

The SUBR XCALL is initially dummy defined to return NIL. However, it can
be used as a handle for calling Fortran subprograms form Lispf4. To do this
you have to add code to the Fortran function XCALL(NO,ARGS), by using the
NO as a 'code selector' and ARGS as a list of arguments to the new routine.
In your Lisp program you then must call XCALL with the NO and ARGS belonging
to the Fortran routine you wish to call. Note that XCALL normally has to
convert Lisp data types into Fortran data types before calling the external
routine, and vice versa when returning a value. 

Note:
If your routine calls the Lispf4 interpreter, you have to write inline code
in Lispf4, making use of recursion conventions.

2. How to add new SUBRs to the heart of Lispf4

Do the following:

a) Insert the function name in the file FLOSYS. The location of
the name is important. The functions are grouped after type and
number of arguments.  (the order is SUBRs with 0 args, SUBR 1
numerical arg, SUBR 1 non-numerical arg, SUBR 2 args, SUBR 3 args,
SUBR n args, FSUBRs). Place the name in the selected list in FLOSYS
and remember the number of the location.

b) Change the corresponding computed GOTO statement in LISPF4, by
inserting a new statement number for the new function. Note that
each group of build tin functions have their own computed goto in
LISPF4. The labels of these computed GOTOs correspond to the lists
in the file FLOSYS.  It is also recommened that you add a comment at
the computed GOTO with the name of the new function.

c) Put your piece of code somewhere. You may access the arguments to
the function through the Fortran variables ARG, ARG2, ARG3. TheY can
also be found on the stack JILL where the variable IARGS is equal to
the actual number of arguments. The first arg is in
jill(index),second in jill(index+1) etc.  Normal return is done by
assigning IRES to the result value and then doing GOTO 998. If your
function is a FSUBR you should return to 999 and not to 998 as these
functions reset whaterver stacks they use themself.  You must
ofcourse do that too. Look at AND to see how it is done.

Warning:  If you make use of CONS, MKNUM, or MATOM explicitly within
your new function (also in XCALL), you must save all references to
Lisp objects so that they can be found in case of garbage
collection. Be sure to always store pointers to Lisp objects you
want to keep in the Fortran variables TEMP1, TEMP2, TEMP3, ARG,
ARG1, or ARG2, because the garbage collection marking is done from
those variables.

ADVICES FOR SAVING SPACE IF YOUR COMPUTER IS A MINI.
 
- Do not use double buffering in I/O.
 
  Some operating systems gives a choice between single and double
  buffering as an option.  Use single!
 
- Rewrite some routines in assembler.
 
  Especially FORTRAN I/O is used in a very trivial manner, and is very
  easy to recode in assembler.  In many cases this will save a lot of
  program storage.
 
- Overlaying.
  The following routines never call each other directly or indirectly
  LISPF4 vs.  INIT1, INIT2.  (INIT2 ought to be replaced by a call to
  ROLLIN anyhow).
  (GARB MARKL REHASH ROLLIN ROLLOUT MOVE) vs.
  (LSPEX NCHARS EQUAL GET).
  But as the last list consists of very small routines only it is
  probably not worth overlaying.  However this list can be extended by
  the routines (IPRINT PRIN1 PRINAT TERPRI) if you remove the call to
  IPRINT and TERPRI from the routine GARB, rename GARB to GARB1 and
  define a small routine GARB which calls GARB1 and then does the
  IPRINT call.
  See also the cross reference listing given in appendix A.
 
- Removing code.
 
  a) In GARB.  Remove the parts that perform atom - bignumber and
  compacting gbc.  Also remove the recursive (inline) code for list
  marking and use MARKL only.
  Remove REHASH.
  This implies that ROLLIN/ROLLOU must read/write the entire list
  space and the hash table HTAB.
 
  b) In PRIN1.  Remove the parts that are active during pretty-print
  only.

    files e.t.c

    MDATE,MTIME,MSLFT,OPENF
 
1.      The "main" routines.
 
1.1 SUBROUTINE MAIN

The main object is:
      CALL INIT1
      CALL INIT2
      CALL LISPF4(1)
      CALL LSPEX
 
 
 
2.      Initiation routines.
 
2.1 SUBROUTINE INIT1
Here all machine depended variables are set. 
 
2.2 SUBROUTINE INIT2
This routine reads the file FLOSYS and sets up the character table,
the symbol table and the list-space memory.  Also some variables
corresponding to some LISP atoms are defined.  It is recommended that
INIT2 is replaced by a call to ROLLIN as soon as a working system is
generated.
 
3.      The "heart" routine.
 
3.1 SUBROUTINE LISPF4(IREE)
 
The eval-apply system and all FORTRAN coded LISP functions.
 
4.      ROLLIN/OUT.
 
4.1 SUBROUTINE ROLLIN(LUN)
 
Reads a file produced by ROLLOU from logical unit LUN.
If rollin is not possible NIL is returned otherwise the value is LUN.
If the size of any array has changed since the last ROLLOU a lot of
pointers must be updated.  This is done by the routine MOVE.
After reading, a new free list is constructed in the empty list space
and the atoms are "rehashed" using the routine REHASH in order to
establish a correct hash table.
Finally read and write buffers are cleared, REWIND LUN is performed
and LUN is returned as the value of ROLLIN.
 
4.2 SUBROUTINE ROLLOU(LUN)
 
The routine saves a binary pattern of the LISP memory to be used later
on (read by ROLLIN).
The following parts of the memory are written on logical unit LUN.
CINF(1-15)      The 18 first words in COMMON /A/.
                Used by ROLLIN to detect if rollin is
                possible.
IMESS(1-im)     All messages.
AREA(1-NAREA)   COMMON /B/ up to (and including) DREG(7).
PNAME(...)      Printnames.  Only used upper and lower parts.
PNP(...)        Printname pointers.  Only used lower parts.
CAR,CDR(...)    Only used lower(atoms) and upper(lists)
                parts.  The free list is not written.
BCOM(1-c)       COMMON /CHARS/.  (character variables).
CHTAB(1-nb)     The character translation table.
 
Before writing a compacting garbage collection is called in order to
save a lot of space and time by not writing the free list.
CINF(1-8) consists of those variables which must not be changed until
next ROLLIN.
CINF(9-15) are those local pointers which may be updated if the sizes
of arrays have been changed.
Help routines to do all writing are DMPOU2 and DUMPUT.
ROLLOU rewindes LUN before returning.
 
4.3 SUBROUTINE MOVE(DIFF,MIN,MAX)
 
Used by ROLLIN to add DIFF to pointers in the range MIN < p <= MAX.
Pointers p are taken from CAR,CDR and ARGS(1-10) where ARGS is
equivalent to ARG, ARG1, ARG2 etc. in COMMON /B/.
 
5.      Garbage collection.
 
5.1 INTEGER FUNCTION GARB(GBCTYP).
 
This is the routine responsible for garbage collection.  The kind of
gbc is indicated by GBCTYP:
 
        GBCTYP   action                           called from
        ------   ------                           -----------
        0        Normal gbc. List cells only.     CONS
        1        List compacting.                 ROLLOU
        2        Big numbers.                     MKNUM
        3        Big numbers and atoms.           MATOM, MKNUM, MKREAL
 
GARB may also have been called form LISPF4 (the LISP function
reclaim(gbctyp) ).
Here is a short description of the working behavior of the garbage
collector:
 
Step 1:
Mark active cells by negating CDR.  If big numbers gbc mark in the
vector PNP.  If atom gbc mark also in CDR of atoms (by temporarily
setting NFREEB = T + 1).
 
Step 2:
Select proper action depending on GBCTYP.
 
       0 goto step 7
       1 goto step 3
       2 goto step 5
       3 goto step 5
 
Step 3:
List compacting (GBCTYP = 1).
Move active CAR CDR to the top of free storage and unmark CDR.  Leave
new address  in CDR of moved cell.  Goto step 6.
 
Step 4:
Atom gbc (GBCTYP = 3).
Move active atoms to the lower part of atom space (lower CAR,CDR).
Leave new address in (negative) HTAB and unmark CDR.  Goto step 6.
 
Step 5:
Big numbers (GBCTYP = 2,3).
Move active numbers (marked in PNP) to the top of PNAME.  Leave new
address in old place in PNAME.  Reset PNP.  If GBCTYP = 2 then goto 6,
otherwise goto step 4.
 
Step 6:
Restore moved pointers (GBCTYP = 1,2,3).
 
Step 7:
Clear memory.
GBCTYP = 0,1    Construct a free list and return.
       = 2      Return.
       = 3      Rehash all saved atoms and return.
 
 
Marking active atoms and cells starts from:
- The COMMON variables ARG ARG2 ARG3 ALIST FORM TEMP1 TEMP2
      TEMP3 I1CONS I2CONS
- Current ASTACK (temporarily saved values).
- CAR and CDR of defined atoms.
 
In the marking phase, a list of all encountered arrays is built up.  The
list is headed by the variable ARRLST.  Then -CDR(ARRLST) points to the
next array etc., until we get to NIL.  The mark phase is finished by
four steps:
 
1.  If ARRLST = NIL then exit.
2.  S:= ARRLST;  ARRLST:=-CDR(S);  CDR(S):=-NIL.
3.  "Start marking from all pointers stored in the array S"
4.  Go to 1.
 
 
2 SUBROUTINE MARKL.

This is a non recursive marking routine used by GARB if local stack
inline code in GARB as it looks upon each cons cell twice.  But in
case of program space problems, you may use only MARKL and remove the
marking code in GARB.
The algorithm is described in Sc 67.
Treats arrays as in GARB.
 
5.3 SUBROUTINE REHASH.
The routine is used for constructing a new entry in HTAB for each
existing atom.  REHASH is called from ROLLIN and from GARB (when atom
gbc is asked for).
 
6.      Input routines.
 
6.1 FUNCTION IREAD(N).
 
(N is a dummy).
IREAD reads an S-expression into internal form.  (See also appendix B
where IREAD is defined in LISP).
It uses RATOM to read separate tokens such as atoms, numbers
parenthesises etc.
The value is a pointer to the constructed S-expression.
 
6.2 INTEGER FUNCTION RATOM(A,IOP).
 
Read by IREAD to read the next token from the input buffer RDBUFF.
(IOP = 1).
RATOM is also called from LISPF4 (IOP = 0).
RATOM classifies the token and returns a type (and a value in the
parameter A) as follows:
 
     token   returned value  returned in A
     -----   --------------  -------------
     atom          1            atom
      (            2            NIL
      )            3            NIL
      '            4            NIL
      .            5          the atom .
 
RATOM keeps < and > in a separate bracket stack and (if called from
IREAD) < or > are never seen but returned as ( or as a proper number
of )'s.
 
6.3 SUBROUTINE SHIFT(I).
 
Reads the next character from the input buffer RDBUFF (and reads a new
line into RDBUFF if necessary).   The character is returned in CHR and
the type of the character in CHT.  The table CHTAB is accessed with
the character value (range 1 - NBYTES) to determine the type.  (A list
of different types is given in LISPF4 - User guide).
 
If I = 1 at entry the previous CHR is stored in ABUFF (the buffer for
a printname given to MATOM).
 
If I = 3 at entry, the previous CHR belongs to a string under
construction and is stored in PNAME.
 
The escape character % is never returned by SHIFT but signals the next
character to be treated as a letter, digit, + or - sign (depending on
its type).
Normally SHIFT is called from RATOM (the flag IFLG2 =NIL) but
sometimes also from the code for unpack(x) in LISPF4 (IFLG2 = T).  If
called from unpack, characters are read from PRBUFF instead and all
characters are treated as if they were prefixed by a %.
 
6.4 INTEGER FUNCTION RDNUMB(INTG) OR
                           (FLO).

(This function does not exist in the code now. The parsing is done
inline in ratom.)
 
This routine is a scanner for a integer/floating point number with
the following syntax:
 
   number ::= sm ! smEsn
   s      ::= + ! - ! empty
   n      ::= d ! dn
   d      ::= 0 ! 1 ! 2 ! 3 ! 4 ! 5 ! 6 ! 7 ! 8 ! 9
   m      ::= n ! n. ! n.n ! .n
 
7.      Output routines.
 
7.1 SUBROUTINE PRIN1(S).
 
This is the routine which prints a S-expression.  The format of the
output is directed by SYSFLAG(i) as follows:
 
      SYSFLAG no      value      means
      ----------      -----      -----
         2            NIL        fast printing
                      T          pretty printing
         3            NIL        (QUOTE s) prints as (QUOTE s)
                      T          (QUOTE s) prints as 's
         5            NIL        Do not add % or "
                      T          Add % or " when so needed
                                 for correct read back.
                                 (This flag is checked by
                                  PRINAT).
                                 Only used during pretty-print.
         7            NIL        Do not begin a new line if
                                 the current expression will
                                 fit on line.
                      T          Begin a new line whenever a
                                 sublist is found unless it is
                                 the first (or sometimes second)
                                 sub-expression.
 
A definition of PRIN1 in LISP is given in appendix B.
 
7.2 SUBROUTINE PRINAT(X,NKW,JPOLD).
 
Prints an atom X or ... (if X = -1) or --- (if X = -2).
NKW is the number of '-s to be printed.
JPOLD is a saved stack pointer which is used to reset the stack in
case of error.
The printname is first stored in PRBUFF, then checked if it fits.
(That is why the size of the print buffer is twice maximum of a
printname).
If overflow has occurred TERPRI print the line up to the old print
position and then the printname for the atom is moved to the proper
position in PRBUFF.
For each character sent to PRBUFF a test by the routine GETCHT is
performed to check whether a % is needed or not.  This check is not
done if SYSFLAG(5) = NIL.
 
7.3 SUBROUTINE PRIFLO(F).
 
Prints the floating point number F.
 
7.4 SUBROUTINE PRIINT(I).
 
Prints the integer I.
 
7.5 SUBROUTINE TERPRI.
 
Writes PRBUFF on logical unit LUNUT and resets PRTPOS (the print
position) to LMARG (current left margin).  If called from NCHARS (the
flag IFLG1 is not = NIL) output is not printed but the numbers of
characters (= value of PRTPOS -1) is accumulated to IFLG1.
 
7.6 SUBROUTINE IPRINT(I).
 
         CALL PRIN1(I)
         CALL TERPRI
         RETURN
         END
 
8.      SOME AUXILIARY ROUTINES FOR LISPF4
 
8.1 FUNCTION MATOM(L).
 
At entry abs(L) character are stored in ABUFF.  If L > 0 MATOM
creates a atom.  Otherwise a sting is constructed.
If an atom with the same printname already exists, that atom is
returned as the value of MATOM; otherwise a new atom is created.  If
no more space for atoms are left a compacting atom garbage collection
is performed.
 
8.2 FUNCTION MKNUM(N).
 
N is a full word integer.
value of N.
 
8.3 SUBROUTINE MKREAL(R).
 
Stores a floating point number in upper PNAME and returns a LISP pointer
to it.
 
8.4 INTEGER FUNCTION GETNUM(I).
 
Returns the FORTRAN integer value of a  LISP number as an integer.
GETNUM converts real numbers to integers. The caller is responsible for
that I is a LISP number.
 
8.5 FUNCTION GTREAL(I,IRETUR).
 
pointer I.  IRETUR will contain the closest integer number.
 
If I points to a small integer, GTREAL will return 0.0 (but IRETUR
will still return the integer value).
 
8.6 INTEGER FUNCTION GETCHT(IC) AND SUBROUTINE SETCHT(IC,IT)
 
These routines are used for fetching/storing the internal type of a
character.  Calling format:
 
        I =GETCHT(IC)
        CALL SETCHT(IC,IT)
 
A character should be placed left justified in IC before calling.  The
integer value of that character is used as an index in the table
CHTAB.  The variable CHDIV is used to calculate this index by an
integer division.
with a new one (IT in SETCHT).
It is recommended to recode GETCHT and SETCHT in assembler.
(Or do this is some faster way than dividing)
 
8.7 INTEGER FUNCTION NCHARS(S,IFLG).
 
This routine is used by the LISP functions concat, pack, unpack and
nchars in order to create a printname representation in PRBUFF.  It is
done by saving the current print status (buffer and pointer) and
calling PRIN1 for each member in S (which is a list of S-expressions).
IFLG = T indicates that % is to be printed by PRIN1  when needed.
The flag IFLG1 is set to NUMADD (not NIL) to indicate to TERPRI that
IFLG1 (in order to count characters).
After calling NCHARS,
 
- concat   creates a string.  TERPRI builds the printnames from
           the print buffer.
- nchars   returns the number of characters.
- pack     creates an atom from the print buffer.
- unpack   creates a list of atoms by reading the print
           buffer character by character.
 
Before returning they must reset the print status.
 
8.8 SUBROUTINE LSPEX.
 
Exits from LISP F4 after writing statistical messages.  The exit is
done by the FORTRAN statement STOP. 
 
8.9 SUBROUTINE MESS(I).
 
If I = 0 then MESS was called from INIT2 and messages are read from
LUNSYS.  Otherwise a message corresponding to the no I is printed.
 
8.10 INTEGER FUNCTION XCALL(FN,L).
 
A dummy function (returns NIL) where you may add your own pieces of
FORTRAN codes such as calling oter subroutines.  Use FN as a selector
in a computed GOTO and L as the argument list.  FN is a FORTRAN
integer at calling.
 
9.      Small routines, push and pop etc.
 
9.1 PUSHING AND POPPING
 
The following subroutines handle ASTACK, the upper part of the array
STACK.  JP points to the current top.
 
   APUSH(I) APUSH2(I,J) APUSH3(I,J,K)
    APOP(I)  APOP2(I,J)  APOP3(I,J,K)
 
(Pushing and popping are done from left to right in the argument
lists).
The subroutine FPUSH(I) pushes a statement number indicator onto
FSTACK, the lower part of STACK.  Here IP points to the current top.
 
address is put onto FSTACK (which forces LISPF4 to jump to the reset
label at next recursive return.).
 
Remark:  In the eval-apply system pushing and popping are coded
inline.  At the entrance of eval there is a check whether the stack
space left is reasonable.
 
9.2 INTEGER FUNCTION CONS(I1,I2)
 
Does cons(I1,I2).
In case of an empty free list garbage collection is activated (GARB).
If the number of free cons cells is less than ISPLFT a weak error is
triggered (SYSERROR - break) and ISPLFT is divided by 2.
ISPLFT is reset to 400 whenever a RESET is performed.
 
9.3 INTEGER FUNCTION SUBST(IX,IY,IS).
 
Does subst(ix,iy,is).
 
(this function is now replaced with SUBPR (substitute pairs) that
is much more genrall) SUBST is then defined in one of the lisp-packges
in terms of subpair.


9.4 INTEGER FUNCTION EQUAL(II,JJ).
 
Does equal(ii,jj).
 
9.5 INTEGER FUNCTION GET(J,I).
 
Does get(j,i).
 
9.6 INTEGER FUNCTION GETPN(X,MAIN,JB,IPL).
 
  MAIN   = Pointer to main string if substring.
  JB     = Byte offset in printname.
  IPL    = Byte length of printname.
  GETPN  = -1  X is invalid.
            0  if X literal atom.
            1  if X string or substring.
 
9.7 INTEGER FUNCTION COMPPN(X,Y).
 
              returns:           if:
               -2                x is invalid
               -1                x < y
                0                x = y
                1                x > y
                2                y is invalid
 
9.8 SUBROUTINE ARRUTL(IPTR,IACTN,IPART,IFIRST,ILEN).
 
This routine performes various array handling functions.
IPTR is a pointer to the array, IPART tells which part of it (1,2,or
3), and IACTN tells what action to be done:
 
IACTN = 1  get array element IFIRST
        2  set array element IFIRST
        3  set IFIRST  and ILEN to array part bounds
 
array part and ILEN is the number of elements.
 
10.     I/O routines.
 
10.1 REMOVED

 
10.2 SUBROUTINE RDA1(LUN,CARD,I1,I2,IEOF).
 
Reads from logical unit LUN to the array CARD(I1-I2) using A1 format.
If end of file is found,IEOF is set to 2.
Used by SHIFT and INIT2.
 
10.3 SUBROUTINE RDA4(LUN,CARD I1,I2)
 
As RDA1 but uses format A4.  Used by MESS.
(or whatever format is a fullword  on your machine)
10.4 SUBROUTINE WRA1(LUN,LINE,I1,I2).
 
Writes LINE(I1-I2) on logical unit LUN using format (1X,150A1).
Used by TERPRI.
 
10.5 SUBROUTINE WRA4(LINE,I1,I2).
 
As WRA1 but uses format (1X,100A4).  Used by MESS.
 
10.6 SUBROUTINE EJECT(LUN).
 
Skip to next page by writing format (1H1) on LUN.
 
10.7 SUBROUTINE REW(LUN).
 
Does REWIND LUN.
 
10.8 SUBROUTINE DMPIN(LUN,AREA,START,STOP)
 
Reads AREA(START-STOP)/LINE(I1-I2) in binary format from logical unit LUN.
Used by ROLLIN.
 
10.9 SUBROUTINE DMPOUT(LUN,AREA,START,STOP)
 
Writes AREA(START-STOP)/LINE(I1-I2) in binary format on logical unit LUN.
Used by ROLLOU.
 
(the two routines dmbin2 and dmpou2 use integer*2 format, if
you use integers as lisppointers (i.e. in CAR and CDR arryes) these
routines can be the same as DMPIN and DMPOUT)
 
11.     Assembler routines.
 
11.1 GETCH AND PUTCH.
 
These routines are coded in assembler and used for moving bytes from/to
an array.  Calling format:
 
       CALL PUTCH(VEC,CH,I)
       Store a character CH at location I in the array VEC.
       CALL GETCH(VEC,CH,I)
 
The character in CH is left justified with space padding.
The array VEC behaves as a character array numbered 1,2,3... (1 = the
leftmost one).
 
11.2 MSLEFT
 
The time scheduling routine which is coded in assembler.
MSLEFT is only called from LISPF4, the LISP function clock().  Use
your own time routine, or skip it if you do not care about the
clock function.

DEFINITION OF EVAL APPLY READ AND PRINT.

(The definition of eval-apply is not absolutely correct
as it is the definition of the old LISPF3 system that used a
