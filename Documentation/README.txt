This is an Interlisp interpreter originally written in Fortran but
converted to C via the F2C Fortran to C converter.  This release has
been tested under Windows, Linux, and Mac and no longer requires F2C
or its associated runtime library.

I had used a slightly older version of this system back in the early
80's and found it very portable, reliable, functional, and fast enough.
I learned Lisp with it and spent quite a bit of time with it back then.

The author (back in 1983) is Mats Nordstrom from Uppsala, Sweden.  I
kept it around, ported it, enhanced some lisp code, and converted it
into C.  Sometime in the late 90's Mats was kind enough to give me a
copy of the latest version he had (8/22/83).  He also gave me
permission to release it so long as I retained his credits.

Interlisp is a dynamically scoped lisp system.  It has no macro facility
but supports LAMBDA (evaluates function arguments), NLAMBDA (doesn't
evaluate its arguments), and variable number of arguments.  Macros are
not hard to simulate.

The system contains no special optimizations such as P-code but has some
good debugging and editing facilities.  It also contains all the basics
such as floating point numbers, arrays, and property lists.

In all the time I've used it I have never found a bug in the base
system (the part written in Fortran) and it has never crashed on me.

The conversion steps I performed are as follows:

1.  Convert the system to C and got it running via the F2C program.

2.  Replace the Fortran calls to equivalent C calls to get rid of the
need for the Fortran support library.

3.  Enabled the use of command line arguments to control startup
options.

4.  Changed memory usage to allow runtime capacity specifications.

5.  Changed some code to make it a little more portable.  (The system
should be highly portable in general though.)

Since I have modified the converted C code you should not attempt to
go from the Fortran code to C without loosing all of my changes.
The Fortran code as-is will not run with F2C without a few tweaks.

The system successfully builds on 32 and 64 bit machines.  You may
need to make some adjustments in f2c.h

The following files are included in the top directory:

lispf41.f	Fortran source - part 1 of 2
lispf42.f	Fortran source - part 2 of 2
lispf4?.c	C version of Fortran code
auxillary.c	Auxiliary C functions
f4com.for	the Fortran common declarations
SYSATOMS	system atoms needed when generating a new system
Makefile.win	makefile for Windows NT using NMAKE
Makefile.unx	makefile for Linux or Mac
*.l		Lisp source files
script.?	scripts to build the image files
f2c.h		used by the .c files
lisf4.orig	the entire original, untouched system

Under Documentation:

Pre-built executables are located under the Windows, Linux & Mac
directories.


Note that you do not want to re-convert the Fortran into C since I
have hand-modified the C files.  All work should be done in the C
files only.  The Fortran code is for reference only.


Building the system
-------------------

To make the lispf4 executable and the two image files by typing:

First, you may want to check the size defaults in the makefile.

Window/MSVC:   nmake -f Makefile.win

Linux or Mac:   make -f Makefile.unx 


Running the system
------------------

In addition to loading lisp source files, lispf4 has the ability to
save/load binary images of a running system.  This enables you to load
an entire pre-loaded image in a short time.  Initially, if no image
file is being loaded, the system requires the SYSATOMS file in order
to build its internal system.  If an image file is being loaded the
SYSATOMS file is not needed or used.  Typically, one builds an image
which contains the common lisp functions and uses that as the base
system.

The makefile builds two image files.  bare.img contains only SYSATOMS.
basic.img contains SYSATOMS and most of the common lisp files.  These
common lisp files flesh out the system and would normally be used.

The command line options are as follows:

	lispf4  [-cN]  [-aN]  [-sN] [-pN]  [FILE.IMG]

	N = a number (no space between the option and N)
	c = car/cdr cells (default 100000)
	a = atoms (default 3000)
	s = stack space (default 1500)
	p = print names / strings / reals / arrays (default 5000)
	FILE.IMG = an image file name

For example Lispf4 can be started in the following ways:

	lispf4

This causes a bare system to startup and SYSATOMS will be loaded.

	lispf4  basic.img

This causes lispf4 to startup and load basic.img.  SYSATOMS is not used.

	lispf4 -c200000  basic.img

This causes lispf4 to set the number of cons cells to 200000 and load
basic.img.

You cannot mix different startup parameters with different image
files.  In other words, you cannot run the system with one
configuration, save an image, and then load it with a lispf4 which was
started with a different set of parameters.



----------------------------------------------------------------------

The raw system is case sensitive and all the built in functions are in
upper case.  basic.img has a lisp file loaded which sets an option to
cause lispf4 to up shift all input so the system becomes case
insensitive.

Lispf4 came with the super-parenthesis defined as <>.  I changed that
to [] in order to match InterLisp.

To exit the system just type:   (EXIT)

Once the system is built you can save and load images as follows:
(Note that this will only work if the proper lisp packages which
perform these operations are loaded.  These files are loaded in
basic.img.)

(SYSOUT "file.img")
(SYSIN  "file.img")

You can also use the makefile lisp package (in MAKEF.L) to load and
save groups of lisp functions in ASCII format as follows:

(CURFILE  name) ; names the group - all functions defined from that point
		  are part of that named group

(MAKEFILE name file T) ; saves all the functions associated with name to file

(LOAD file) ; loads the file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

XCALL
-----

Opening files:

(XCALL 1 '(lfn file status form))

	lfn    = logical file number
	file   = file name
	status = OLD or NEW
	form   = FORMATTED or UNFORMATTED
                 FORMATTED = ASCII files
                 UNFORMATTED = binary or sysout files

Closing files:

(XCALL 2 lfn)

Conditional (IF) package (IFDO.L)
------------------------

Requires MATCH.L

This function is compatible with both the MIT version and the keyword
version at UCB.

  simple summary:
   non-keyword use:
       (IF a b) ==> (COND (a b))
       (IF a b c d e ...) ==> (COND (a b) (t c d e ...))
   with keywords:
       (IF a THEN b) ==> (COND (a b))
       (IF a THENRET) ==> (COND (a))
       (IF a THEN b c d e) ==> (COND (a b c d e))
       (IF a THEN b c  ELSE d) ==> (COND (a b c) (t d))
       (IF a THEN b c  ELSEIF d  THENRET  ELSE g)
               ==> (COND (a b c) (d) (t g))


 In the syntax description below,
    optional parts are surrounded by [ and ],
    + means one or more instances.
    | means 'or'
    <expr> is an lisp expression which isn't a keyword
       The keywords are:  THEN, THENRET, ELSE, ELSEIF.
    <pred> is also a lisp expression which isn't a keyword.
 
 <if-stmt> ::=  <simple-if-stmt>
              | <keyword-if-stmt>
 
 <simple-if-stmt> ::=  (IF <pred> <expr>)
                     | (IF <pred> <expr> <expr>)
 
 <keyword-if-stmt> ::= (IF <pred> <then-clause> [ <else-clause> ] )
 
 <then-clause> ::=  THEN <expr>+
                  | THENRET

 virtually no idea what my notes mean. B.M.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structures package (STRUCT.L)
------------------

Requires MATCH.L

This package enables one to create nested, named data structures.

(SPUT A K V F)

	A = the litatom which will represent the data structure
	K = the key.
	    NIL  = A will be set to V.  Any other structure of A will be
		   overwritten
	    atom = the same as (atom)
	    list = each element of the list will specify the key of sucessive
		   levels of the data structure A
	V = the value.  Any lisp object which will be placed at position K
	F = flag
	    NIL = value V overwrites any previous value for key K
	    T   = value V is CONS'ed to any previous value at K

	The value returned is the entire structure A

(SMEMBER A K V)

	A = the litatom which will represent the data structure
	K = the key.
	    NIL  = Top level.
	    atom = the same as (atom)
	    list = each element of the list will specify the key of sucessive
		   levels of the data structure A
	V = matching value
	    NIL = return T if key K exists, NIL otherwise
	    other = return T if V matches or is an element of the value at K

(SNEXT  A)

	Returns the first key/value list and drops it from A

(SCHANGE A K S)

	A = the structure
	K = key
	S = the new name of the final level indicated by K

	Returns NIL if the change is unsuccessful.

(SGETNAMES A K)

	A = the structure
	K = key
	    NIL  = all keys
	    atom = same as (atom)
	    list = return names at level specified by K

(SREMOVE A K V)

	A = the structure
	K = same as above K
	V = value
	    NIL = remove entire level indicated by K
	    atom or list = remove the atom or list from the value at level K

(SGET A K)

	same arguments

(SCLAMP A K A2 K2 V F F2)

	Sets A at K and A2 at K2 to V and adds them depending on F and F2

(SATTACH A K A2 K2 F)

	Sets A at K to point to the value of A2 at K2.
	The value is added if F is T.
